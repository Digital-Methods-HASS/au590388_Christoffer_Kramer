55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3,1
55,"Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4,1
55,"Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.  Their",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,5,1
55,"house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,6,1
55,"many miles.  There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,7,1
55,"room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,8,1
55,"the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.  Uncle Henry",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,9,1
55,"and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,10,1
55,"another corner.  There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,11,1
55,"small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,12,1
55,"could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,13,1
55,crush any building in its path.  It was reached by a trap door in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,14,1
55,"middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,15,1
55,hole.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,16,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,17,1
55,"When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,18,1
55,nothing but the great gray prairie on every side.  Not a tree nor a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,19,1
55,house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,20,1
55,the sky in all directions.  The sun had baked the plowed land into a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,21,1
55,"gray mass, with little cracks running through it.  Even the grass was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,22,1
55,"not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,23,1
55,they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.  Once the house,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,24,1
55,"had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,25,1
55,"it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,26,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,27,1
55,"When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife.  The sun",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,28,1
55,"and wind had changed her, too.  They had taken the sparkle from her",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,29,1
55,eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,30,1
55,"and lips, and they were gray also.  She was thin and gaunt, and never",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,31,1
55,"smiled now.  When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,32,1
55,Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,33,1
55,and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,34,1
55,reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,35,1
55,that she could find anything to laugh at.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,36,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,37,1
55,Uncle Henry never laughed.  He worked hard from morning till night and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,38,1
55,"did not know what joy was.  He was gray also, from his long beard to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,39,1
55,"his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,40,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,41,1
55,"It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,42,1
55,as her other surroundings.  Toto was not gray; he was a little black,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,43,1
55,"dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,44,1
55,"either side of his funny, wee nose.  Toto played all day long, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,45,1
55,"Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,46,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,47,1
55,"Today, however, they were not playing.  Uncle Henry sat upon the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,48,1
55,"doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,49,1
55,"usual.  Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,50,1
55,the sky too.  Aunt Em was washing the dishes.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,51,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,52,1
55,"From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,53,1
55,and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,54,1
55,coming storm.  There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,55,1
55,"south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,56,1
55,grass coming from that direction also.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,57,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,58,1
55,Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,59,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,60,1
55,"""There's a cyclone coming, Em,"" he called to his wife.  ""I'll go look",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,61,1
55,"after the stock.""  Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,62,1
55,horses were kept.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,63,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,64,1
55,Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door.  One glance told her of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,65,1
55,the danger close at hand.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,66,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,67,1
55,"""Quick, Dorothy!"" she screamed.  ""Run for the cellar!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,68,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,69,1
55,"Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,70,1
55,"started to get him.  Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,71,1
55,"door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,72,1
55,hole.  Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,73,1
55,When she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,74,1
55,"wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,75,1
55,down suddenly upon the floor.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,76,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,77,1
55,Then a strange thing happened.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,78,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,79,1
55,The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,80,1
55,air.  Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,81,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,82,1
55,"The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,83,1
55,exact center of the cyclone.  In the middle of a cyclone the air is,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,84,1
55,"generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,85,1
55,"the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,86,1
55,of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,87,1
55,away as easily as you could carry a feather.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,88,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,89,1
55,"It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,90,1
55,"found she was riding quite easily.  After the first few whirls around,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,91,1
55,"and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,92,1
55,"being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,93,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,94,1
55,"Toto did not like it.  He ran about the room, now here, now there,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,95,1
55,barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,96,1
55,see what would happen.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,97,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,98,1
55,"Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,99,1
55,the little girl thought she had lost him.  But soon she saw one of his,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,100,1
55,"ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,101,1
55,"was keeping him up so that he could not fall.  She crept to the hole,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,102,1
55,"caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,103,1
55,closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,104,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,105,1
55,"Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,106,1
55,"but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,107,1
55,her that she nearly became deaf.  At first she had wondered if she,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,108,1
55,would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,109,1
55,"passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,110,1
55,to wait calmly and see what the future would bring.  At last she,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,111,1
55,"crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,112,1
55,Toto followed and lay down beside her.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,113,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,114,1
55,"In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,115,1
55,Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,116,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,117,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,118,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,119,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,120,1
55,2.  The Council with the Munchkins,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,121,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,122,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,123,2
55,"She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,124,2
55,"not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt.  As it was,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,125,2
55,the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,126,2
55,Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,127,2
55,Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,128,2
55,"dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,129,2
55,little room.  She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,130,2
55,and opened the door.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,131,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,132,2
55,"The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,133,2
55,growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,134,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,135,2
55,The cyclone had set the house down very gently--for a cyclone--in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,136,2
55,midst of a country of marvelous beauty.  There were lovely patches of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,137,2
55,"greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,138,2
55,"fruits.  Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,139,2
55,rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,140,2
55,"A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,141,2
55,"green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,142,2
55,"who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,143,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,144,2
55,"While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,145,2
55,she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,146,2
55,ever seen.  They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,147,2
55,"used to; but neither were they very small.  In fact, they seemed about",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,148,2
55,"as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,149,2
55,"they were, so far as looks go, many years older.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,150,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,151,2
55,"Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed.  They wore",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,152,2
55,"round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,153,2
55,little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved.  The,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,154,2
55,"hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,155,2
55,wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders.  Over it were,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,156,2
55,sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds.  The,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,157,2
55,"men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,158,2
55,"well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops.  The men,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,159,2
55,"Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,160,2
55,beards.  But the little woman was doubtless much older.  Her face was,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,161,2
55,"covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,162,2
55,stiffly.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,163,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,164,2
55,When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,165,2
55,"doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,166,2
55,"come farther.  But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,167,2
55,"low bow and said, in a sweet voice:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,168,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,169,2
55,"""You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,170,2
55,We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,171,2
55,"East, and for setting our people free from bondage.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,172,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,173,2
55,Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder.  What could the little,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,174,2
55,"woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,175,2
55,"killed the Wicked Witch of the East?  Dorothy was an innocent, harmless",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,176,2
55,"little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,177,2
55,and she had never killed anything in all her life.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,178,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,179,2
55,"But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,180,2
55,"with hesitation, ""You are very kind, but there must be some mistake.  I",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,181,2
55,"have not killed anything.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,182,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,183,2
55,"""Your house did, anyway,"" replied the little old woman, with a laugh,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,184,2
55,"""and that is the same thing.  See!"" she continued, pointing to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,185,2
55,"corner of the house.  ""There are her two feet, still sticking out from",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,186,2
55,"under a block of wood.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,187,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,188,2
55,"Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright.  There, indeed, just",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,189,2
55,"under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,190,2
55,"sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,191,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,192,2
55,"""Oh, dear!  Oh, dear!"" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,193,2
55,"dismay.  ""The house must have fallen on her.  Whatever shall we do?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,194,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,195,2
55,"""There is nothing to be done,"" said the little woman calmly.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,196,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,197,2
55,"""But who was she?"" asked Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,198,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,199,2
55,"""She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,"" answered the little",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,200,2
55,"woman.  ""She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,201,2
55,"making them slave for her night and day.  Now they are all set free,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,202,2
55,"and are grateful to you for the favor.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,203,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,204,2
55,"""Who are the Munchkins?"" inquired Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,205,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,206,2
55,"""They are the people who live in this land of the East",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,207,2
55," where the Wicked Witch ruled.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,208,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,209,2
55,"""Are you a Munchkin?"" asked Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,210,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,211,2
55,"""No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,212,2
55,When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,213,2
55,"messenger to me, and I came at once.  I am the Witch of the North.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,214,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,215,2
55,"""Oh, gracious!"" cried Dorothy.  ""Are you a real witch?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,216,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,217,2
55,"""Yes, indeed,"" answered the little woman.  ""But I am a good witch, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,218,2
55,the people love me.  I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,219,2
55,"ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,220,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,221,2
55,"""But I thought all witches were wicked,"" said the girl, who was half",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,222,2
55,"frightened at facing a real witch.  ""Oh, no, that is a great mistake.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,223,2
55,"There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,224,2
55,"those who live in the North and the South, are good witches.  I know",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,225,2
55,"this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,226,2
55,"Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,227,2
55,"but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,228,2
55,"in all the Land of Oz--the one who lives in the West.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,229,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,230,2
55,"""But,"" said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, ""Aunt Em has told me",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,231,2
55,"that the witches were all dead--years and years ago.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,232,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,233,2
55,"""Who is Aunt Em?"" inquired the little old woman.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,234,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,235,2
55,"""She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,236,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,237,2
55,"The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,238,2
55,"and her eyes upon the ground.  Then she looked up and said, ""I do not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,239,2
55,"know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,240,2
55,"before.  But tell me, is it a civilized country?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,241,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,242,2
55,"""Oh, yes,"" replied Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,243,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,244,2
55,"""Then that accounts for it.  In the civilized countries I believe there",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,245,2
55,"are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians.  But,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,246,2
55,"you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,247,2
55,from all the rest of the world.  Therefore we still have witches and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,248,2
55,"wizards amongst us.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,249,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,250,2
55,"""Who are the wizards?"" asked Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,251,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,252,2
55,"""Oz himself is the Great Wizard,"" answered the Witch, sinking her voice",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,253,2
55,"to a whisper.  ""He is more powerful than all the rest of us together.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,254,2
55,"He lives in the City of Emeralds.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,255,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,256,2
55,"Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,257,2
55,"who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,258,2
55,corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,259,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,260,2
55,"""What is it?"" asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,261,2
55,"laugh.  The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,262,2
55,nothing was left but the silver shoes.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,263,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,264,2
55,"""She was so old,"" explained the Witch of the North, ""that she dried up",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,265,2
55,quickly in the sun.  That is the end of her.  But the silver shoes are,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,266,2
55,"yours, and you shall have them to wear."" She reached down and picked up",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,267,2
55,"the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,268,2
55,Dorothy.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,269,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,270,2
55,"""The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,"" said one of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,271,2
55,"the Munchkins, ""and there is some charm connected with them; but what",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,272,2
55,"it is we never knew.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,273,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,274,2
55,Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,275,2
55,Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,276,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,277,2
55,"""I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,278,2
55,"worry about me.  Can you help me find my way?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,279,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,280,2
55,"The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,281,2
55,"Dorothy, and then shook their heads.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,282,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,283,2
55,"""At the East, not far from here,"" said one, ""there is a great desert,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,284,2
55,"and none could live to cross it.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,285,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,286,2
55,"""It is the same at the South,"" said another, ""for I have been there and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,287,2

55,"will have to live with us.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,296,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,297,2
55,"Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,298,2
55,"strange people.  Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,299,2
55,for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,300,2
55,"also.  As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,301,2
55,"the point on the end of her nose, while she counted ""One, two, three""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,302,2

55,"straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,351,2
55,"barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,352,2

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,362,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,363,3
55,When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry.  So she went to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,364,3
55,"the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,365,3
55,"She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,366,3
55,"down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,367,3
55,Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,368,3
55,"there.  Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,369,3
55,"from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,370,3
55,she wanted to help out her breakfast.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,371,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,372,3
55,"Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,373,3
55,"a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,374,3
55,the journey to the City of Emeralds.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,375,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,376,3
55,"Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,377,3
55,"hanging on a peg beside her bed.  It was gingham, with checks of white",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,378,3
55,"and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,379,3
55,"it was still a pretty frock.  The girl washed herself carefully,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,380,3
55,"dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,381,3
55,her head.  She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,382,3
55,"cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top.  Then she looked down at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,383,3
55,her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,384,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,385,3
55,"""They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,"" she said.  And",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,386,3
55,Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,387,3
55,tail to show he knew what she meant.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,388,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,389,3
55,At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,390,3
55,belonged to the Witch of the East.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,391,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,392,3
55,"""I wonder if they will fit me,"" she said to Toto.  ""They would be just",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,393,3
55,"the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,394,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,395,3
55,"She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,396,3
55,fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,397,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,398,3
55,Finally she picked up her basket.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,399,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,400,3
55,"""Come along, Toto,"" she said.  ""We will go to the Emerald City and ask",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,401,3
55,"the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,402,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,403,3
55,"She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,404,3
55,"of her dress.  And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,405,3
55,started on her journey.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,406,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,407,3
55,"There were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,408,3
55,the one paved with yellow bricks.  Within a short time she was walking,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,409,3
55,"briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,410,3
55,"the hard, yellow road-bed.  The sun shone bright and the birds sang",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,411,3
55,"sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,412,3
55,little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,413,3
55,country and set down in the midst of a strange land.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,414,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,415,3
55,"She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,416,3
55,"was about her.  There were neat fences at the sides of the road,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,417,3
55,"painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,418,3
55,vegetables in abundance.  Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,419,3
55,"able to raise large crops.  Once in a while she would pass a house, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,420,3
55,the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,421,3
55,everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,422,3
55,setting them free from bondage.  The houses of the Munchkins were,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,423,3
55,"odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,424,3
55,"All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,425,3
55,favorite color.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,426,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,427,3
55,"Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,428,3
55,"wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,429,3
55,larger than the rest.  On the green lawn before it many men and women,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,430,3
55,"were dancing.  Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,431,3
55,"the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,432,3
55,"loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,433,3
55,good things to eat.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,434,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,435,3
55,"The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,436,3
55,pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,437,3
55,"Munchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,438,3
55,celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,439,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,440,3
55,Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,441,3
55,"himself, whose name was Boq.  Then she sat upon a settee and watched",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,442,3
55,the people dance.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,443,3

55,"""Why?"" asked the girl.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,447,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,448,3
55,"""Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,449,3
55,"Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,450,3
55,"wear white.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,451,3

55,wrinkles in it.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,454,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,455,3
55,"""It is kind of you to wear that,"" said Boq.  ""Blue is the color of the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,456,3
55,"Munchkins, and white is the witch color.  So we know you are a friendly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,457,3
55,"witch.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,458,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,459,3
55,"Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,460,3
55,"think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,461,3
55,little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,462,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,463,3
55,"When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,464,3
55,where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it.  The sheets were made,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,465,3
55,"of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,466,3
55,Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,467,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,468,3
55,"She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,469,3
55,with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,470,3
55,"greatly amused Dorothy.  Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,471,3
55,for they had never seen a dog before.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,472,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,473,3
55,"""How far is it to the Emerald City?"" the girl asked.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,474,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,475,3
55,"""I do not know,"" answered Boq gravely, ""for I have never been there.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,476,3
55,"It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,477,3
55,"with him.  But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,478,3
55,"you many days.  The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,479,3
55,pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,480,3
55,"your journey.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,481,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,482,3
55,"This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,483,3
55,"could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,484,3
55,back.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,485,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,486,3
55,"She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,487,3
55,yellow brick.  When she had gone several miles she thought she would,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,488,3
55,"stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,489,3
55,"and sat down.  There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,490,3
55,"far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,491,3
55,from the ripe corn.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,492,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,493,3
55,Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,494,3
55,"Scarecrow.  Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,495,3
55,"nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face.  An old, pointed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,496,3
55,"blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,497,3
55,"and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,498,3
55,which had also been stuffed with straw.  On the feet were some old,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,499,3
55,"boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,500,3
55,figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,501,3
55,up its back.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,502,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,503,3
55,"While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,504,3
55,"Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,505,3
55,"She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,506,3
55,scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,507,3
55,head to her in a friendly way.  Then she climbed down from the fence,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,508,3
55,"and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,509,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,510,3

55,"""Did you speak?"" asked the girl, in wonder.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,513,3

55,"do?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,518,3

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,595,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,596,4
55,"After a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,597,4
55,"difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,598,4
55,"which were here very uneven.  Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,599,4
55,"missing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,600,4
55,"walked around.  As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he walked",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,601,4
55,"straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,602,4
55,"on the hard bricks.  It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,603,4
55,"him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,604,4
55,merrily at his own mishap.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,605,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,606,4
55,The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,607,4
55,"back.  There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,608,4
55,they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,609,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,610,4
55,"At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,611,4
55,opened her basket and got out some bread.  She offered a piece to the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,612,4

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,622,4
55,"""Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,"" said",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,623,4
55,"the Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner.  So she told him all",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,624,4
55,"about Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,625,4
55,had carried her to this queer Land of Oz.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,626,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,627,4
55,"The Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, ""I cannot understand why",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,628,4

55,"The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,646,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,647,4
55,"""My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever.  I was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,648,4
55,only made day before yesterday.  What happened in the world before that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,649,4
55,"time is all unknown to me.  Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,650,4
55,"of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,651,4
55,"was going on.  There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,652,4
55,"I heard was the farmer saying, 'How do you like those ears?'",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,653,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,654,4
55,"""'They aren't straight,'"" answered the other.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,655,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,656,4
55,"""'Never mind,'"" said the farmer.  ""'They are ears just the same,'""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,657,4
55,which was true enough.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,658,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,659,4
55,"""'Now I'll make the eyes,'"" said the farmer.  So he painted my right",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,660,4
55,"eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,661,4
55,"at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,662,4
55,first glimpse of the world.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,663,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,664,4
55,"""'That's a rather pretty eye,'"" remarked the Munchkin who was watching",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,665,4
55,"the farmer.  ""'Blue paint is just the color for eyes.'",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,666,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,667,4
55,"""'I think I'll make the other a little bigger,'"" said the farmer.  And",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,668,4
55,when the second eye was done I could see much better than before.  Then,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,669,4
55,"he made my nose and my mouth.  But I did not speak, because at that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,670,4
55,time I didn't know what a mouth was for.  I had the fun of watching,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,671,4
55,them make my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,672,4
55,"head, at last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,673,4
55,man as anyone.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,674,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,675,4
55,"""'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,' said the farmer.  'He",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,676,4
55,looks just like a man.',The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,677,4

55,"""'Why, he is a man,' said the other, and I quite agreed with him.  The",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,679,4
55,"farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,680,4
55,"tall stick, where you found me.  He and his friend soon after walked",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,681,4
55,away and left me alone.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,682,4

55,"""I did not like to be deserted this way.  So I tried to walk after",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,684,4
55,"them.  But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,685,4
55,"on that pole.  It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,686,4
55,"of, having been made such a little while before.  Many crows and other",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,687,4
55,"birds flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,688,4
55,"away again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,689,4
55,feel that I was quite an important person.  By and by an old crow flew,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,690,4
55,"near me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,691,4
55,and said:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,692,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,693,4
55,"""'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,694,4
55,Any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.',The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,695,4
55,Then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted.  The,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,696,4
55,"other birds, seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,697,4
55,so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,698,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,699,4
55,"""I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,700,4

55,"brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,702,4
55,better man than some of them.  Brains are the only things worth having,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,703,4

55,"""After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,706,4
55,hard to get some brains.  By good luck you came along and pulled me off,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,707,4

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,719,4
55,"There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,720,4

55,trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,722,4
55,"road of yellow brick.  It was almost dark under the trees, for the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,723,4
55,"branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,724,4
55,went on into the forest.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,725,4

55,"it leads us.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,729,4

55,"Toto could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,738,4
55,declared he could see as well as by day.  So she took hold of his arm,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,739,4
55,and managed to get along fairly well.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,740,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,741,4
55,"""If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,"" she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,742,4

55,"corner.  She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,755,4
55,"a sound sleep.  The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,756,4

55,"would need the oil-can badly.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,874,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,875,5
55,"It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,876,5
55,soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,877,5
55,where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,878,5
55,travelers could not pass.  But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,879,5
55,and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,880,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,881,5
55,Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,882,5
55,notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,883,5
55,side of the road.  Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,884,5
55,again.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,885,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,886,5
55,"""Why didn't you walk around the hole?"" asked the Tin Woodman.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,887,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,888,5
55,"""I don't know enough,"" replied the Scarecrow cheerfully.  ""My head is",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,889,5
55,"stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,890,5
55,"him for some brains.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,891,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,892,5
55,"""Oh, I see,"" said the Tin Woodman.  ""But, after all, brains are not the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,893,5
55,"best things in the world.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,894,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,895,5
55,"""Have you any?"" inquired the Scarecrow.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,896,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,897,5
55,"""No, my head is quite empty,"" answered the Woodman.  ""But once I had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,898,5
55,"brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,899,5
55,"rather have a heart.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,900,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,901,5
55,"""And why is that?"" asked the Scarecrow.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,902,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,903,5
55,"""I will tell you my story, and then you will know.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,904,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,905,5
55,"So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,906,5
55,the following story:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,907,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,908,5
55,"""I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,909,5
55,"and sold the wood for a living.  When I grew up, I too became a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,910,5
55,"woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,911,5
55,long as she lived.  Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,912,5
55,"I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,913,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,914,5
55,"""There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,915,5
55,"grew to love her with all my heart.  She, on her part, promised to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,916,5
55,marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,917,5
55,for her; so I set to work harder than ever.  But the girl lived with an,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,918,5
55,"old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,919,5
55,wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,920,5
55,"housework.  So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,921,5
55,promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,922,5
55,"Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,923,5
55,"away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,924,5
55,"wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,925,5
55,left leg.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,926,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,927,5
55,"""This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,928,5
55,could not do very well as a wood-chopper.  So I went to a tinsmith and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,929,5
55,"had him make me a new leg out of tin.  The leg worked very well, once I",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,930,5
55,"was used to it.  But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,931,5
55,for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,932,5
55,"Munchkin girl.  When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,933,5
55,"my right leg.  Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,934,5
55,"out of tin.  After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,935,5
55,"the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,936,5
55,"The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,937,5
55,first I thought that was the end of me.  But the tinsmith happened to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,938,5
55,"come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,939,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,940,5
55,"""I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,941,5
55,ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be.  She thought of a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,942,5
55,"new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,943,5
55,"axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,944,5
55,two halves.  Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,945,5
55,"of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,946,5
55,"joints, so that I could move around as well as ever.  But, alas!  I had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,947,5
55,"now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,948,5
55,not care whether I married her or not.  I suppose she is still living,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,949,5
55,"with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,950,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,951,5
55,"""My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,952,5
55,"it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,953,5
55,There was only one danger--that my joints would rust; but I kept an,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,954,5
55,oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,955,5
55,"However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,956,5
55,"in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,957,5
55,and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me.  It was,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,958,5
55,"a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,959,5
55,time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,960,5
55,heart.  While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,961,5
55,"can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,962,5
55,"one.  If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,963,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,964,5
55,Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,965,5
55,"of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,966,5
55,new heart.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,967,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,968,5
55,"""All the same,"" said the Scarecrow, ""I shall ask for brains instead of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,969,5
55,a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,970,5
55,"one.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,971,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,972,5
55,"""I shall take the heart,"" returned the Tin Woodman; ""for brains do not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,973,5
55,"make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,974,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,975,5
55,"Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,976,5
55,"two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,977,5
55,"Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,978,5
55,"no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,979,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,980,5
55,"What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,981,5
55,"meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket.  To be sure, neither",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,982,5
55,"the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,983,5
55,"of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,984,5

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,990,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,991,6
55,All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,992,6
55,"thick woods.  The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,993,6
55,"were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,994,6
55,the walking was not at all good.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,995,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,996,6
55,"There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,997,6
55,open country where there is plenty of sunshine.  But now and then there,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,998,6
55,came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees.  These,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,999,6
55,"sounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1000,6
55,"what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's side,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1001,6
55,and did not even bark in return.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1002,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1003,6
55,"""How long will it be,"" the child asked of the Tin Woodman, ""before we",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1004,6
55,"are out of the forest?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1005,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1006,6
55,"""I cannot tell,"" was the answer, ""for I have never been to the Emerald",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1007,6
55,"City.  But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1008,6
55,"was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1009,6
55,city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful.  But I am not afraid so,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1010,6
55,"long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1011,6
55,"you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch's kiss, and that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1012,6
55,"will protect you from harm.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1013,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1014,6
55,"""But Toto!"" said the girl anxiously.  ""What will protect him?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1015,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1016,6
55,"""We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,"" replied the Tin",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1017,6
55,Woodman.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1018,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1019,6
55,"Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1020,6
55,next moment a great Lion bounded into the road.  With one blow of his,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1021,6
55,paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1022,6
55,"road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws.  But,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1023,6
55,"to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1024,6
55,although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1025,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1026,6
55,"Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1027,6

55,"Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1029,6
55,"forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1030,6

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1035,6

55,"known it.  But how can I help it?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1043,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1044,6
55,"""I don't know, I'm sure.  To think of your striking a stuffed man, like",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1045,6
55,"the poor Scarecrow!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1046,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1047,6
55,"""Is he stuffed?"" asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1048,6
55,"the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1049,6
55,shape again.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1050,6

55,"""Of course he's stuffed,"" replied Dorothy, who was still angry.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1052,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1053,6
55,"""That's why he went over so easily,"" remarked the Lion.  ""It astonished",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1054,6

55,again.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1058,6

55,"""That's why he nearly blunted my claws,"" said the Lion.  ""When they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1060,6
55,scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back.  What,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1061,6
55,"is that little animal you are so tender of?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1062,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1063,6
55,"""He is my dog, Toto,"" answered Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1064,6

55,"""Neither.  He's a--a--a meat dog,"" said the girl.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1068,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1069,6
55,"""Oh!  He's a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1070,6

55,"coward like me,"" continued the Lion sadly.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1072,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1073,6
55,"""What makes you a coward?"" asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1074,6
55,"wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1075,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1076,6
55,"""It's a mystery,"" replied the Lion.  ""I suppose I was born that way.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1077,6
55,"All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1078,6

55,out of my way.  Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1081,6
55,"just roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1082,6
55,If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1083,6
55,"me, I should have run myself--I'm such a coward; but just as soon as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1084,6
55,"they hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1085,6
55,"them go.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1086,6

55,been crushed between the Lion's great jaws.  But after a time he became,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1139,6
55,"more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1140,6
55,good friends.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1141,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1142,6
55,During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1143,6
55,"peace of their journey.  Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1144,6
55,"beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1145,6
55,"thing.  This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1146,6
55,careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1147,6
55,several tears of sorrow and regret.  These tears ran slowly down his,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1148,6

55,Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1150,6
55,"his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together.  He became",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1151,6
55,greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1152,6
55,"him, but she could not understand.  The Lion was also puzzled to know",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1153,6
55,what was wrong.  But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1154,6
55,"basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1155,6
55,could talk as well as before.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1156,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1157,6
55,"""This will serve me a lesson,"" said he, ""to look where I step.  For if",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1158,6
55,"I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1159,6
55,"crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1160,6

55,"Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1162,6
55,"when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1163,6
55,"harm it.  The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1164,6
55,he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1165,6
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1166,6
55,"""You people with hearts,"" he said, ""have something to guide you, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1167,6
55,"need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1168,6

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1175,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1176,7
55,They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1177,7
55,"forest, for there were no houses near.  The tree made a good, thick",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1178,7
55,"covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1179,7
55,great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1180,7
55,warmed her and made her feel less lonely.  She and Toto ate the last of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1181,7
55,"their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1182,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1183,7
55,"""If you wish,"" said the Lion, ""I will go into the forest and kill a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1184,7
55,"deer for you.  You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1185,7
55,"peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1186,7
55,"good breakfast.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1187,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1188,7
55,"""Don't!  Please don't,"" begged the Tin Woodman.  ""I should certainly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1189,7
55,"weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1190,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1191,7
55,"But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1192,7
55,"one ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it.  And the Scarecrow",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1193,7
55,"found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1194,7
55,that she would not be hungry for a long time.  She thought this was,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1195,7
55,"very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1196,7
55,the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts.  His,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1197,7
55,padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1198,7
55,almost as many as he put in the basket.  But the Scarecrow did not mind,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1199,7
55,"how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1200,7
55,"away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1201,7
55,"burn him up.  So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1202,7
55,came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1203,7
55,"These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1204,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1205,7
55,"When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1206,7
55,"brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1207,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1208,7
55,This was to be an eventful day for the travelers.  They had hardly been,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1209,7
55,walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1210,7
55,the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1211,7
55,"side.  It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1212,7
55,"looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1213,7
55,"many big, jagged rocks at the bottom.  The sides were so steep that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1214,7
55,"none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1215,7
55,journey must end.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1216,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1217,7
55,"""What shall we do?"" asked Dorothy despairingly.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1218,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1219,7
55,"""I haven't the faintest idea,"" said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1220,7
55,his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1221,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1222,7
55,"But the Scarecrow said, ""We cannot fly, that is certain.  Neither can",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1223,7
55,"we climb down into this great ditch.  Therefore, if we cannot jump over",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1224,7
55,"it, we must stop where we are.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1225,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1226,7

55,the distance carefully in his mind.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1228,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1229,7
55,"""Then we are all right,"" answered the Scarecrow, ""for you can carry us",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1230,7
55,"all over on your back, one at a time.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1231,7

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1234,7
55,"""I will,"" declared the Scarecrow, ""for, if you found that you could not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1235,7
55,"jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1236,7
55,dented on the rocks below.  But if I am on your back it will not matter,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1237,7
55,"so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1238,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1239,7
55,"""I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,"" said the Cowardly Lion, ""but",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1240,7
55,I suppose there is nothing to do but try it.  So get on my back and we,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1241,7
55,"will make the attempt.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1242,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1243,7
55,"The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion's back, and the big beast walked to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1244,7
55,edge of the gulf and crouched down.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1245,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1246,7
55,"""Why don't you run and jump?"" asked the Scarecrow.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1247,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1248,7
55,"""Because that isn't the way we Lions do these things,"" he replied.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1249,7
55,"Then giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1250,7
55,on the other side.  They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1251,7
55,"did it, and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1252,7
55,sprang across the ditch again.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1253,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1254,7
55,Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1255,7
55,"climbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1256,7
55,The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1257,7
55,"then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1258,7
55,"side.  The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1259,7
55,then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1260,7
55,"rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1261,7
55,a big dog that has been running too long.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1262,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1263,7
55,"They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1264,7
55,gloomy.  After the Lion had rested they started along the road of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1265,7
55,"yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1266,7
55,would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1267,7
55,"To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1268,7
55,"depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1269,7
55,this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1270,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1271,7
55,"""What are the Kalidahs?"" asked the girl.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1272,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1273,7
55,"""They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1274,7
55,"tigers,"" replied the Lion, ""and with claws so long and sharp that they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1275,7
55,could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto.  I'm terribly,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1276,7
55,"afraid of the Kalidahs.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1277,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1278,7
55,"""I'm not surprised that you are,"" returned Dorothy.  ""They must be",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1279,7
55,"dreadful beasts.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1280,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1281,7
55,The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1282,7
55,across the road.  But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1283,7
55,at once he could not leap across it.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1284,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1285,7
55,"So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1286,7

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1288,7
55,"""Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch.  If the Tin Woodman",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1289,7

55,"across it easily.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1291,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1292,7
55,"""That is a first-rate idea,"" said the Lion.  ""One would almost suspect",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1293,7
55,"you had brains in your head, instead of straw.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1294,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1295,7
55,"The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1296,7
55,was soon chopped nearly through.  Then the Lion put his strong front,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1297,7
55,"legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1298,7
55,"tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1299,7
55,branches on the other side.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1300,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1301,7
55,They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1302,7
55,"made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1303,7
55,two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1304,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1305,7
55,"""They are the Kalidahs!"" said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1306,7

55,"followed, and the Scarecrow came next.  The Lion, although he was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1311,7
55,"certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1312,7
55,and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1313,7
55,"backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1314,7
55,in surprise.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1315,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1316,7
55,"But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1317,7
55,"were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1318,7
55,"forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1319,7
55,would do next.  Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1320,7
55,began to cross the tree.  And the Lion said to Dorothy:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1321,7

55,"best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1328,7
55,the tree that rested on their side of the ditch.  The Tin Woodman began,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1329,7
55,"to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1330,7
55,"across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1331,7
55,"snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1332,7
55,rocks at the bottom.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1333,7

55,"""Well,"" said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, ""I see",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1335,7
55,"we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1336,7
55,must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive.  Those creatures,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1337,7
55,"frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1338,7

55,to ride on the Lion's back.  To their great joy the trees became,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1344,7
55,"thinner the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1345,7
55,"came upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them.  On the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1346,7
55,other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1347,7
55,"through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1348,7
55,flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1349,7

55,before them.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1351,7

55,"""That is easily done,"" replied the Scarecrow.  ""The Tin Woodman must",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1355,7
55,"build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1356,7
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1357,7

55,"a raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1359,7
55,"riverbank a tree full of fine fruit.  This pleased Dorothy, who had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1360,7
55,"eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1361,7
55,fruit.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1362,7

55,"But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1364,7
55,"untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1365,7
55,So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1366,7

55,"full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1377,8
55,plums from the trees beside the river.  Behind them was the dark forest,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1378,8
55,"they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1379,8
55,"discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1380,8
55,seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1381,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1382,8
55,"To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1383,8

55,"badly, for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1388,8
55,"stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1389,8
55,hands to push the raft through the water.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1390,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1391,8
55,"They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1392,8

55,that the long poles would not touch the bottom.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1395,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1396,8
55,"""This is bad,"" said the Tin Woodman, ""for if we cannot get to the land",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1397,8

55,"""We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,"" the Scarecrow",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1409,8
55,"continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1410,8
55,"the mud at the bottom of the river.  Then, before he could pull it out",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1411,8
55,"again--or let go--the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was left",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1412,8
55,clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1413,8

55,stuck on a pole in the middle of a river.  I am afraid I shall never,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1424,8
55,"have any brains, after all!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1425,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1426,8
55,"Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1427,8
55,behind.  Then the Lion said:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1428,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1429,8
55,"""Something must be done to save us.  I think I can swim to the shore",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1430,8
55,"and pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1431,8
55,"tail.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1432,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1433,8
55,"So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1434,8
55,his tail.  Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1435,8
55,"shore.  It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1436,8
55,"were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1437,8
55,long pole and helped push the raft to the land.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1438,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1439,8
55,They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1440,8
55,"off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1441,8
55,carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1442,8
55,Emerald City.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1443,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1444,8
55,"""What shall we do now?"" asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1445,8
55,the grass to let the sun dry him.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1446,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1447,8
55,"""We must get back to the road, in some way,"" said Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1448,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1449,8
55,"""The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1450,8
55,"road again,"" remarked the Lion.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1451,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1452,8
55,"So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1453,8
55,"started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1454,8
55,"carried them.  It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1455,8
55,"fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1456,8
55,"for the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1457,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1458,8
55,"They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1459,8
55,pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1460,8
55,"""Look!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1461,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1462,8
55,Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1463,8
55,"his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1464,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1465,8
55,"""What can we do to save him?"" asked Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1466,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1467,8
55,"The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1468,8
55,So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1469,8
55,"until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1470,8
55,water's edge.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1471,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1472,8
55,"""Who are you and where are you going?"" asked the Stork.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1473,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1474,8
55,"""I am Dorothy,"" answered the girl, ""and these are my friends, the Tin",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1475,8
55,"Woodman and the Cowardly Lion;  and we are going to the Emerald City.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1476,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1477,8
55,"""This isn't the road,"" said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1478,8
55,looked sharply at the queer party.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1479,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1480,8
55,"""I know it,"" returned Dorothy, ""but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1481,8
55,"wondering how we shall get him again.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1482,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1483,8
55,"""Where is he?"" asked the Stork.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1484,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1485,8
55,"""Over there in the river,"" answered the little girl.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1486,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1487,8
55,"""If he wasn't so big and heavy I would get him for you,"" remarked the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1488,8
55,Stork.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1489,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1490,8
55,"""He isn't heavy a bit,"" said Dorothy eagerly, ""for he is stuffed with",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1491,8
55,"straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1492,8
55,"and ever so much.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1493,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1494,8
55,"""Well, I'll try,"" said the Stork, ""but if I find he is too heavy to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1495,8
55,"carry I shall have to drop him in the river again.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1496,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1497,8
55,So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1498,8
55,where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole.  Then the Stork with her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1499,8
55,great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1500,8
55,"the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1501,8
55,Woodman and Toto were sitting.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1502,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1503,8
55,"When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1504,8
55,"happy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1505,8
55,"walked along he sang ""Tol-de-ri-de-oh!"" at every step, he felt so gay.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1506,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1507,8
55,"""I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,"" he said,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1508,8
55,"""but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1509,8
55,"the Stork again and do her some kindness in return.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1510,8

55,"""I always like to help anyone in trouble.  But I must go now, for my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1513,8

55,"Emerald City and that Oz will help you.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1515,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1516,8

55,and was soon out of sight.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1518,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1519,8
55,They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1520,8
55,birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1521,8
55,the ground was carpeted with them.  There were big yellow and white and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1522,8
55,"blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1523,8
55,which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy's eyes.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1524,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1525,8
55,"""Aren't they beautiful?"" the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1526,8
55,scent of the bright flowers.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1527,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1528,8
55,"""I suppose so,"" answered the Scarecrow.  ""When I have brains, I shall",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1529,8
55,"probably like them better.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1530,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1531,8
55,"""If I only had a heart, I should love them,"" added the Tin Woodman.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1532,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1533,8
55,"""I always did like flowers,"" said the Lion.  ""They seem so helpless",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1534,8
55,"and frail.  But there are none in the forest so bright as these.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1535,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1536,8
55,"They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1537,8
55,and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1538,8
55,midst of a great meadow of poppies.  Now it is well known that when,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1539,8
55,there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1540,8
55,"anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1541,8
55,"away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever.  But",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1542,8
55,"Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1543,8
55,flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1544,8
55,and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1545,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1546,8
55,But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1547,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1548,8
55,"""We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1549,8
55,he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him.  So they kept walking until,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1550,8
55,Dorothy could stand no longer.  Her eyes closed in spite of herself and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1551,8
55,"she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1552,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1553,8
55,"""What shall we do?"" asked the Tin Woodman.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1554,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1555,8
55,"""If we leave her here she will die,"" said the Lion.  ""The smell of the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1556,8
55,"flowers is killing us all.  I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1557,8
55,"and the dog is asleep already.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1558,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1559,8
55,It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress.  But the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1560,8
55,"Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1561,8
55,troubled by the scent of the flowers.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1562,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1563,8
55,"""Run fast,"" said the Scarecrow to the Lion, ""and get out of this deadly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1564,8
55,"flower bed as soon as you can.  We will bring the little girl with us,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1565,8
55,"but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1566,8

55,In a moment he was out of sight.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1569,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1570,8
55,"""Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,"" said the Scarecrow.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1571,8
55,"So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy's lap, and then they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1572,8
55,made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1573,8
55,and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1574,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1575,8
55,"On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1576,8
55,flowers that surrounded them would never end.  They followed the bend,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1577,8
55,"of the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1578,8
55,asleep among the poppies.  The flowers had been too strong for the huge,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1579,8
55,"beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1580,8
55,"from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1581,8
55,beautiful green fields before them.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1582,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1583,8
55,"""We can do nothing for him,"" said the Tin Woodman, sadly; ""for he is",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1584,8
55,"much too heavy to lift.  We must leave him here to sleep on forever,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1585,8
55,"and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1586,8

55,"one so cowardly.  But let us go on.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1589,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1590,8
55,"They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1591,8
55,enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1592,8
55,"poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1593,8
55,and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1594,8

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1600,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1601,9
55,"""We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,"" remarked the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1602,9

55,"as the river carried us away.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1604,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1605,9
55,"The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1606,9
55,turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1607,9
55,"beast come bounding over the grass toward them.  It was, indeed, a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1608,9
55,"great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1609,9
55,"something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1610,9
55,"wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1611,9
55,like balls of fire.  As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1612,9
55,"before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1613,9
55,heart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1614,9
55,"pretty, harmless creature.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1615,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1616,9
55,"So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1617,9
55,"quick blow that cut the beast's head clean off from its body, and it",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1618,9
55,rolled over at his feet in two pieces.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1619,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1620,9
55,"The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1621,9

55,At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1638,9
55,"little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1639,9

55,"scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1651,9
55,seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1652,9
55,right into the middle of the group.  Toto had always loved to chase,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1653,9
55,"mice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1654,9

55,So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1706,9
55,"made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1707,9
55,the leaves and branches.  He fastened it together with wooden pegs and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1708,9
55,made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk.  So fast,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1709,9
55,and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1710,9
55,truck was all ready for them.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1711,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1712,9
55,"They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1713,9
55,mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1714,9
55,piece of string in his mouth.  It was about this time that Dorothy woke,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1715,9
55,from her long sleep and opened her eyes.  She was greatly astonished to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1716,9
55,"find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1717,9
55,around and looking at her timidly.  But the Scarecrow told her about,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1718,9
55,"everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1719,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1720,9
55,"""Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1721,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1722,9
55,"Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1723,9
55,became quite friendly with the little girl.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1724,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1725,9
55,The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1726,9
55,"truck, using the strings they had brought.  One end of a string was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1727,9
55,tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck.  Of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1728,9
55,course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1729,9
55,"were to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1730,9
55,able to pull it quite easily.  Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1731,9
55,"could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1732,9
55,the place where the Lion lay asleep.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1733,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1734,9
55,"After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1735,9
55,to get him up on the truck.  Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1736,9
55,"the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1737,9
55,too long they also would fall asleep.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1738,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1739,9
55,"At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1740,9
55,the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1741,9
55,"from behind, and they got along better.  Soon they rolled the Lion out",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1742,9
55,"of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1743,9
55,"fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1744,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1745,9
55,Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1746,9
55,her companion from death.  She had grown so fond of the big Lion she,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1747,9
55,was glad he had been rescued.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1748,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1749,9
55,Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1750,9
55,through the grass to their homes.  The Queen of the Mice was the last,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1751,9
55,to leave.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1752,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1753,9
55,"""If ever you need us again,"" she said, ""come out into the field and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1754,9
55,"call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance.  Good-bye!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1755,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1756,9
55,"""Good-bye!"" they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1757,9
55,held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1758,9
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1759,9
55,After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1760,9
55,"the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1761,9
55,ate for her dinner.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1762,9

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1768,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1769,10
55,"It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1770,10
55,"among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1771,10
55,but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1772,10
55,to find himself still alive.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1773,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1774,10
55,"""I ran as fast as I could,"" he said, sitting down and yawning, ""but the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1775,10
55,"flowers were too strong for me.  How did you get me out?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1776,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1777,10
55,"Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1778,10
55,"him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1779,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1780,10
55,"""I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1781,10
55,"things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1782,10
55,"mice have saved my life.  How strange it all is!  But, comrades, what",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1783,10
55,"shall we do now?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1784,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1785,10
55,"""We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,"" said",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1786,10
55,"Dorothy, ""and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1787,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1788,10
55,"So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1789,10
55,"they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1790,10
55,"the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1791,10
55,of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1792,10
55,Great Oz dwelt.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1793,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1794,10
55,"The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1795,10
55,"beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1796,10
55,"behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1797,10
55,Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1798,10
55,"painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1799,10
55,"evidently lived, that also was painted green.  They passed by several",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1800,10
55,"of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1801,10
55,doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1802,10
55,"one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1803,10
55,which they were very much afraid.  The people were all dressed in,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1804,10
55,clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1805,10
55,those of the Munchkins.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1806,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1807,10
55,"""This must be the Land of Oz,"" said Dorothy, ""and we are surely getting",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1808,10
55,"near the Emerald City.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1809,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1810,10
55,"""Yes,"" answered the Scarecrow.  ""Everything is green here, while in the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1811,10
55,country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color.  But the people,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1812,10
55,"do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I'm afraid we shall",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1813,10
55,"be unable to find a place to pass the night.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1814,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1815,10
55,"""I should like something to eat besides fruit,"" said the girl, ""and I'm",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1816,10

55,"the people.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1818,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1819,10
55,"So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1820,10
55,to the door and knocked.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1821,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1822,10
55,"A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, ""What do you",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1823,10
55,"want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1824,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1825,10
55,"""We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,"" answered",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1826,10

55,"for the world.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1828,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1829,10
55,"""Is he tame?"" asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1830,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1831,10
55,"""Oh, yes,"" said the girl, ""and he is a great coward, too.  He will be",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1832,10
55,"more afraid of you than you are of him.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1833,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1834,10
55,"""Well,"" said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1835,10
55,"at the Lion, ""if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1836,10
55,"some supper and a place to sleep.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1837,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1838,10
55,"So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1839,10
55,"children and a man.  The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1840,10
55,couch in a corner.  They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1841,10
55,"company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1842,10

55,"""Where are you all going?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1844,10

55,"""That is hard to tell,"" said the man thoughtfully.  ""You see, Oz is a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1864,10

55,"he looks like a cat.  To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1867,10

55,"hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1901,10
55,"usually has his own way.  But what do YOU want?"" he continued, speaking",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1902,10

55,"The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1909,10

55,Dorothy and put them over her eyes.  There were two golden bands,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1977,10
55,"fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1978,10
55,were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1979,10
55,"Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck.  When they were on, Dorothy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1980,10
55,"could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1981,10
55,"to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1982,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1983,10
55,Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1984,10
55,"Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1985,10
55,with the key.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1986,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1987,10
55,Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1988,10
55,was ready to show them to the Palace.  Taking a big golden key from a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1989,10
55,"peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1990,10
55,through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1991,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1992,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1993,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1994,10
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1995,10
55,11.  The Wonderful City of Oz,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1996,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1997,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1998,11
55,"Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1999,11
55,friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2000,11
55,The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2001,11
55,and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds.  They walked over a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2002,11
55,"pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2003,11
55,"together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2004,11
55,brightness of the sun.  The window panes were of green glass; even the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2005,11
55,"sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2006,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2007,11
55,"There were many people--men, women, and children--walking about, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2008,11
55,these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins.  They,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2009,11
55,looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2010,11
55,"eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2011,11
55,they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them.  Many shops stood in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2012,11
55,"street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green.  Green candy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2013,11
55,"and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2014,11
55,"hats, and green clothes of all sorts.  At one place a man was selling",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2015,11
55,"green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2016,11
55,they paid for it with green pennies.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2017,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2018,11
55,There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2019,11
55,"things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2020,11
55,Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2021,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2022,11
55,The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2023,11
55,"to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2024,11
55,"Palace of Oz, the Great Wizard.  There was a soldier before the door,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2025,11
55,dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2026,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2027,11
55,"""Here are strangers,"" said the Guardian of the Gates to him, ""and they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2028,11
55,"demand to see the Great Oz.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2029,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2030,11
55,"""Step inside,"" answered the soldier, ""and I will carry your message to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2031,11
55,"him.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2032,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2033,11
55,So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2034,11
55,with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds.  The,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2035,11
55,soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2036,11
55,"this room, and when they were seated he said politely:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2037,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2038,11
55,"""Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2039,11
55,"Throne Room and tell Oz you are here.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2040,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2041,11
55,"They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned.  When, at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2042,11
55,"last, he came back, Dorothy asked:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2043,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2044,11
55,"""Have you seen Oz?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2045,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2046,11
55,"""Oh, no,"" returned the soldier; ""I have never seen him.  But I spoke to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2047,11
55,him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message.  He said he,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2048,11
55,"will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2049,11
55,"enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2050,11
55,"Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2051,11
55,have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2052,11
55,"journey.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2053,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2054,11
55,"""Thank you,"" replied the girl; ""that is very kind of Oz.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2055,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2056,11
55,"The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2057,11
55,"dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room.  She had lovely",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2058,11
55,"green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2059,11
55,"said, ""Follow me and I will show you your room.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2060,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2061,11
55,"So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2062,11
55,dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2063,11
55,three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2064,11
55,"Palace.  It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2065,11
55,comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2066,11
55,"counterpane.  There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2067,11
55,"shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2068,11
55,beautifully carved green marble basin.  Beautiful green flowers stood,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2069,11
55,"in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2070,11
55,When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2071,11
55,"green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2072,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2073,11
55,"In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2074,11
55,velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2075,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2076,11
55,"""Make yourself perfectly at home,"" said the green girl, ""and if you",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2077,11
55,wish for anything ring the bell.  Oz will send for you tomorrow,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2078,11
55,"morning.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2079,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2080,11
55,She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others.  These she also led,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2081,11
55,"to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2082,11
55,part of the Palace.  Of course this politeness was wasted on the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2083,11
55,Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2084,11
55,"stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2085,11
55,"It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2086,11
55,he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2087,11
55,"web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2088,11
55,wonderful rooms in the world.  The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2089,11
55,"force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2090,11
55,"being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2091,11
55,to make sure they kept in good working order.  The Lion would have,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2092,11
55,"preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2093,11
55,"shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2094,11
55,he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2095,11
55,himself asleep in a minute.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2096,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2097,11
55,"The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2098,11
55,"Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2099,11
55,green brocaded satin.  Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2100,11
55,"green ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2101,11
55,of the Great Oz.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2102,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2103,11
55,First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2104,11
55,"of the court, all dressed in rich costumes.  These people had nothing",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2105,11
55,"to do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2106,11
55,"Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2107,11
55,"Oz.  As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2108,11
55,whispered:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2109,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2110,11
55,"""Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2111,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2112,11
55,"""Of course,"" answered the girl, ""if he will see me.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2113,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2114,11
55,"""Oh, he will see you,"" said the soldier who had taken her message to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2115,11
55,"the Wizard, ""although he does not like to have people ask to see him.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2116,11
55,"Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2117,11
55,"came from.  Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2118,11
55,your silver shoes he was very much interested.  At last I told him,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2119,11
55,"about the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2120,11
55,"his presence.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2121,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2122,11
55,"Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, ""That is the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2123,11
55,"signal.  You must go into the Throne Room alone.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2124,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2125,11
55,She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2126,11
55,"herself in a wonderful place.  It was a big, round room with a high",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2127,11
55,"arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2128,11
55,large emeralds set closely together.  In the center of the roof was a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2129,11
55,"great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2130,11
55,wonderful manner.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2131,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2132,11
55,But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2133,11
55,that stood in the middle of the room.  It was shaped like a chair and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2134,11
55,"sparkled with gems, as did everything else.  In the center of the chair",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2135,11
55,"was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2136,11
55,"whatever.  There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2137,11
55,"and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2138,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2139,11
55,"As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2140,11
55,"and looked at her sharply and steadily.  Then the mouth moved, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2141,11
55,Dorothy heard a voice say:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2142,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2143,11
55,"""I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.  Who are you, and why do you seek me?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2144,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2145,11
55,It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2146,11
55,Head; so she took courage and answered:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2147,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2148,11
55,"""I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek.  I have come to you for help.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2149,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2150,11
55,The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute.  Then said the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2151,11
55,voice:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2152,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2153,11
55,"""Where did you get the silver shoes?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2154,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2155,11
55,"""I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2156,11
55,"her and killed her,"" she replied.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2157,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2158,11
55,"""Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?"" continued the voice.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2159,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2160,11
55,"""That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2161,11
55,"good-bye and sent me to you,"" said the girl.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2162,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2163,11
55,"Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2164,11
55,"truth.  Then Oz asked, ""What do you wish me to do?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2165,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2166,11
55,"""Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,"" she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2167,11
55,"answered earnestly.  ""I don't like your country, although it is so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2168,11
55,beautiful.  And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2169,11
55,"being away so long.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2170,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2171,11
55,"The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2172,11
55,down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2173,11
55,every part of the room.  And at last they looked at Dorothy again.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2174,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2175,11
55,"""Why should I do this for you?"" asked Oz.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2176,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2177,11
55,"""Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2178,11
55,"and I am only a little girl.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2179,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2180,11

55,Oz.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2182,11

55,"""Well,"" said the Head, ""I will give you my answer.  You have no right",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2186,11
55,to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2187,11
55,in return.  In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2188,11
55,If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2189,11
55,"something for me first.  Help me and I will help you.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2190,11

55,"""Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,"" answered Oz.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2194,11

55,"""But I cannot!"" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2196,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2197,11
55,"""You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2198,11
55,bear a powerful charm.  There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2199,11
55,"this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2200,11
55,"Kansas--but not before.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2201,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2202,11
55,"The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2203,11
55,"eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2204,11
55,felt that she could help him if she would.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2205,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2206,11
55,"""I never killed anything, willingly,"" she sobbed.  ""Even if I wanted",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2207,11
55,"to, how could I kill the Wicked Witch?  If you, who are Great and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2208,11

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2210,11
55,"""I do not know,"" said the Head; ""but that is my answer, and until the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2211,11
55,Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again.  Remember,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2212,11
55,that the Witch is Wicked--tremendously Wicked--and ought to be killed.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2213,11

55,and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2217,11
55,"said to her.  ""There is no hope for me,"" she said sadly, ""for Oz will",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2218,11

55,went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2223,11
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2224,11
55,The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2225,11

55,"""Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2228,11

55,So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2230,11
55,"Room, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2231,11
55,She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2232,11
55,"locks a crown of jewels.  Growing from her shoulders were wings,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2233,11
55,gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2234,11

55,"did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2281,11
55,"hoped it would be the lovely Lady.  ""For,"" he said to himself, ""if it",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2282,11

55,"It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2290,11
55,strong enough to hold its weight.  The Beast had a head like that of a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2291,11

55,"you will not be harmed.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2519,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2520,12
55,"So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2521,12
55,and stretched out his arms.  And when the crows saw him they were,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2522,12
55,"frightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2523,12
55,to come any nearer.  But the King Crow said:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2524,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2525,12
55,"""It is only a stuffed man.  I will peck his eyes out.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2526,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2527,12
55,"The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2528,12
55,"twisted its neck until it died.  And then another crow flew at him, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2529,12
55,"the Scarecrow twisted its neck also.  There were forty crows, and forty",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2530,12
55,"times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2531,12
55,"beside him.  Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2532,12
55,went upon their journey.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2533,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2534,12
55,When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2535,12
55,"heap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2536,12
55,silver whistle.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2537,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2538,12
55,"Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2539,12
55,black bees came flying toward her.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2540,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2541,12
55,"""Go to the strangers and sting them to death!"" commanded the Witch, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2542,12
55,the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2543,12
55,"her friends were walking.  But the Woodman had seen them coming, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2544,12
55,the Scarecrow had decided what to do.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2545,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2546,12
55,"""Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2547,12
55,"the Lion,"" he said to the Woodman, ""and the bees cannot sting them.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2548,12
55,"This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2549,12
55,"Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2550,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2551,12
55,"The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2552,12
55,"at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2553,12
55,the Woodman at all.  And as bees cannot live when their stings are,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2554,12
55,"broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2555,12
55,"about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2556,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2557,12
55,"Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2558,12
55,"put the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2559,12
55,ever.  So they started upon their journey once more.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2560,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2561,12
55,The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2562,12
55,heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2563,12
55,"gnashed her teeth.  And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2564,12
55,"the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2565,12
55,strangers and destroy them.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2566,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2567,12
55,"The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2568,12
55,told.  So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy.  Then the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2569,12
55,"Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2570,12
55,were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2571,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2572,12
55,When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2573,12
55,"strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2574,12
55,think what she should do next.  She could not understand how all her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2575,12
55,plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2576,12
55,"Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2577,12
55,act.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2578,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2579,12
55,"There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2580,12
55,rubies running round it.  This Golden Cap had a charm.  Whoever owned,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2581,12
55,"it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2582,12
55,order they were given.  But no person could command these strange,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2583,12
55,creatures more than three times.  Twice already the Wicked Witch had,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2584,12
55,used the charm of the Cap.  Once was when she had made the Winkies her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2585,12
55,"slaves, and set herself to rule over their country.  The Winged Monkeys",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2586,12
55,had helped her do this.  The second time was when she had fought,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2587,12
55,"against the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2588,12
55,West.  The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this.  Only once,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2589,12
55,"more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2590,12
55,to do so until all her other powers were exhausted.  But now that her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2591,12
55,"fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2592,12
55,"her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2593,12
55,only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2594,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2595,12
55,So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2596,12
55,upon her head.  Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2597,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2598,12
55,"""Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2599,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2600,12
55,Next she stood upon her right foot and said:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2601,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2602,12
55,"""Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2603,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2604,12
55,After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2605,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2606,12
55,"""Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2607,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2608,12
55,"Now the charm began to work.  The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2609,12
55,"sound was heard in the air.  There was a rushing of many wings, a great",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2610,12
55,"chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2611,12
55,"the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2612,12
55,immense and powerful wings on his shoulders.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2613,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2614,12
55,"One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader.  He flew",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2615,12
55,"close to the Witch and said, ""You have called us for the third and last",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2616,12
55,"time.  What do you command?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2617,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2618,12
55,"""Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2619,12
55,"the Lion,"" said the Wicked Witch.  ""Bring that beast to me, for I have",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2620,12
55,"a mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2621,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2622,12
55,"""Your commands shall be obeyed,"" said the leader.  Then, with a great",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2623,12
55,"deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2624,12
55,where Dorothy and her friends were walking.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2625,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2626,12
55,Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2627,12
55,air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2628,12
55,"Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2629,12
55,"rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2630,12
55,nor groan.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2631,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2632,12
55,"Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2633,12
55,pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head.  They made his hat,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2634,12
55,and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2635,12
55,branches of a tall tree.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2636,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2637,12
55,The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2638,12
55,"wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2639,12
55,to bite or scratch or struggle in any way.  Then they lifted him up and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2640,12
55,"flew away with him to the Witch's castle, where he was placed in a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2641,12
55,"small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2642,12
55,escape.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2643,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2644,12
55,"But Dorothy they did not harm at all.  She stood, with Toto in her",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2645,12
55,"arms, watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2646,12
55,"be her turn.  The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2647,12
55,"long, hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2648,12
55,he saw the mark of the Good Witch's kiss upon her forehead and stopped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2649,12
55,"short, motioning the others not to touch her.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2650,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2651,12
55,"""We dare not harm this little girl,"" he said to them, ""for she is",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2652,12
55,"protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2653,12
55,Evil.  All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2654,12
55,"and leave her there.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2655,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2656,12
55,"So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2657,12
55,"her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2658,12
55,set her down upon the front doorstep.  Then the leader said to the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2659,12
55,Witch:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2660,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2661,12
55,"""We have obeyed you as far as we were able.  The Tin Woodman and the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2662,12
55,"Scarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard.  The",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2663,12
55,"little girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2664,12
55,"Your power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2665,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2666,12
55,"Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2667,12
55,"noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2668,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2669,12
55,The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2670,12
55,"on Dorothy's forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2671,12
55,"Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way.  She looked",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2672,12
55,"down at Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2673,12
55,"with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them.  At",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2674,12
55,first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2675,12
55,to look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2676,12
55,"was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2677,12
55,"Silver Shoes gave her.  So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2678,12
55,"thought, ""I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2679,12
55,"use her power."" Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2680,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2681,12
55,"""Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2682,12
55,"do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2683,12
55,"Scarecrow.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2684,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2685,12
55,Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2686,12
55,"until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2687,12
55,and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2688,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2689,12
55,"Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2690,12
55,she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2691,12
55,her.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2692,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2693,12
55,"With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2694,12
55,courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2695,12
55,"her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2696,12
55,go to drive.  But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2697,12
55,"bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2698,12
55,shut the gate again.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2699,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2700,12
55,"""If I cannot harness you,"" said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2701,12
55,"the bars of the gate, ""I can starve you.  You shall have nothing to eat",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2702,12
55,"until you do as I wish.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2703,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2704,12
55,So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2705,12
55,"she came to the gate at noon and asked, ""Are you ready to be harnessed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2706,12
55,"like a horse?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2707,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2708,12
55,"And the Lion would answer, ""No.  If you come in this yard, I will bite",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2709,12
55,"you.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2710,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2711,12
55,The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2712,12
55,"every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2713,12
55,the cupboard.  After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2714,12
55,"straw, and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2715,12
55,"shaggy mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2716,12
55,"way to escape.  But they could find no way to get out of the castle,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2717,12
55,"for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2718,12
55,slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2719,12
55,them.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2720,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2721,12
55,"The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2722,12
55,threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2723,12
55,"her hand.  But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2724,12
55,"of the mark upon her forehead.  The child did not know this, and was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2725,12
55,full of fear for herself and Toto.  Once the Witch struck Toto a blow,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2726,12
55,with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2727,12
55,"in return.  The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2728,12
55,so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2729,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2730,12
55,Dorothy's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2731,12
55,be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again.  Sometimes,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2732,12
55,"she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2733,12
55,"looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2734,12
55,his little mistress.  Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2735,12
55,or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2736,12
55,"little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2737,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2738,12
55,Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2739,12
55,Shoes which the girl always wore.  Her bees and her crows and her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2740,12
55,"wolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2741,12
55,power of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2742,12
55,"Shoes, they would give her more power than all the other things she had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2743,12
55,"lost.  She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2744,12
55,"shoes, thinking she might steal them.  But the child was so proud of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2745,12
55,her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2746,12
55,she took her bath.  The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2747,12
55,"go in Dorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2748,12
55,"was greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2749,12
55,"Dorothy was bathing.  Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2750,12
55,ever let water touch her in any way.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2751,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2752,12
55,"But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2753,12
55,trick that would give her what she wanted.  She placed a bar of iron in,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2754,12
55,"the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2755,12
55,iron invisible to human eyes.  So that when Dorothy walked across the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2756,12
55,"floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2757,12
55,"full length.  She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2758,12
55,"Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2759,12
55,it away and put it on her own skinny foot.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2760,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2761,12
55,"The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2762,12
55,as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2763,12
55,"charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2764,12
55,to do so.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2765,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2766,12
55,"The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2767,12
55,"angry, and said to the Witch, ""Give me back my shoe!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2768,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2769,12
55,"""I will not,"" retorted the Witch, ""for it is now my shoe, and not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2770,12
55,"yours.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2771,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2772,12
55,"""You are a wicked creature!"" cried Dorothy.  ""You have no right to take",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2773,12
55,"my shoe from me.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2774,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2775,12
55,"""I shall keep it, just the same,"" said the Witch, laughing at her, ""and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2776,12
55,"someday I shall get the other one from you, too.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2777,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2778,12
55,This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2779,12
55,"that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2780,12
55,foot.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2781,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2782,12
55,"Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2783,12
55,"Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2784,12
55,away.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2785,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2786,12
55,"""See what you have done!"" she screamed.  ""In a minute I shall melt",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2787,12
55,"away.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2788,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2789,12
55,"""I'm very sorry, indeed,"" said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2790,12
55,the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2791,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2792,12
55,"""Didn't you know water would be the end of me?"" asked the Witch, in a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2793,12
55,"wailing, despairing voice.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2794,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2795,12
55,"""Of course not,"" answered Dorothy.  ""How should I?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2796,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2797,12
55,"""Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2798,12
55,"castle to yourself.  I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2799,12
55,a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2800,12
55,"deeds.  Look out--here I go!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2801,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2802,12
55,"With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2803,12
55,and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor.  Seeing,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2804,12
55,"that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2805,12
55,of water and threw it over the mess.  She then swept it all out the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2806,12
55,"door.  After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2807,12
55,"of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2808,12
55,"her foot again.  Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2809,12
55,out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2810,12
55,"had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2811,12
55,land.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2812,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2813,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2814,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2815,12
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2816,12
55,13.  The Rescue,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2817,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2818,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2819,13
55,The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2820,13
55,"been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2821,13
55,"of his prison and set him free.  They went in together to the castle,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2822,13
55,where Dorothy's first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2823,13
55,them that they were no longer slaves.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2824,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2825,13
55,"There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2826,13
55,"made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2827,13
55,always treated them with great cruelty.  They kept this day as a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2828,13
55,"holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2829,13
55,dancing.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2830,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2831,13
55,"""If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us,""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2832,13
55,"said the Lion, ""I should be quite happy.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2833,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2834,13
55,"""Don't you suppose we could rescue them?"" asked the girl anxiously.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2835,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2836,13
55,"""We can try,"" answered the Lion.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2837,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2838,13
55,So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2839,13
55,"rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2840,13
55,"to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2841,13
55,bondage.  So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2842,13
55,"knew the most, and they all started away.  They traveled that day and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2843,13
55,part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2844,13
55,"Woodman lay, all battered and bent.  His axe was near him, but the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2845,13
55,blade was rusted and the handle broken off short.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2846,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2847,13
55,"The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2848,13
55,"the Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2849,13
55,"sad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2850,13
55,When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2851,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2852,13
55,"""Are any of your people tinsmiths?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2853,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2854,13
55,"""Oh, yes.  Some of us are very good tinsmiths,"" they told her.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2855,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2856,13
55,"""Then bring them to me,"" she said.  And when the tinsmiths came,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2857,13
55,"bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, ""Can you",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2858,13
55,"straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2859,13
55,"shape again, and solder him together where he is broken?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2860,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2861,13
55,The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2862,13
55,they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever.  So,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2863,13
55,they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2864,13
55,"worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2865,13
55,bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2866,13
55,"and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2867,13
55,"his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever.  To be sure, there",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2868,13
55,"were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2869,13
55,the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2870,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2871,13
55,"When, at last, he walked into Dorothy's room and thanked her for",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2872,13
55,"rescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2873,13
55,"had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2874,13
55,joints would not be rusted.  At the same time her own tears fell thick,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2875,13
55,"and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2876,13
55,"did not need to be wiped away.  As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2877,13
55,"often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2878,13
55,obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2879,13
55,dried.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2880,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2881,13
55,"""If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,"" said the Tin Woodman,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2882,13
55,"when Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, ""I",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2883,13
55,"should be quite happy.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2884,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2885,13
55,"""We must try to find him,"" said the girl.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2886,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2887,13
55,"So she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2888,13
55,part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2889,13
55,which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow's clothes.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2890,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2891,13
55,"It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2892,13
55,"climb it; but the Woodman said at once, ""I'll chop it down, and then we",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2893,13
55,"can get the Scarecrow's clothes.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2894,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2895,13
55,"Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2896,13
55,"another of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2897,13
55,"solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman's axe, instead of the old",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2898,13
55,broken handle.  Others polished the blade until all the rust was,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2899,13
55,removed and it glistened like burnished silver.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2900,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2901,13
55,"As soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2902,13
55,"time the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow's clothes",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2903,13
55,fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2904,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2905,13
55,Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2906,13
55,"castle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold!",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2907,13
55,"here was the Scarecrow, as good as ever, thanking them over and over",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2908,13
55,again for saving him.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2909,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2910,13
55,"Now that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2911,13
55,"days at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2912,13
55,make them comfortable.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2913,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2914,13
55,"But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, ""We must go back to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2915,13
55,"Oz, and claim his promise.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2916,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2917,13
55,"""Yes,"" said the Woodman, ""at last I shall get my heart.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2918,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2919,13
55,"""And I shall get my brains,"" added the Scarecrow joyfully.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2920,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2921,13
55,"""And I shall get my courage,"" said the Lion thoughtfully.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2922,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2923,13
55,"""And I shall get back to Kansas,"" cried Dorothy, clapping her hands.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2924,13
55,"""Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2925,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2926,13
55,This they decided to do.  The next day they called the Winkies together,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2927,13
55,"and bade them good-bye.  The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2928,13
55,they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2929,13
55,and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West.  Finding they were,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2930,13
55,"determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2931,13
55,collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2932,13
55,"diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2933,13
55,to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2934,13
55,"silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2935,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2936,13
55,"Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2937,13
55,and all shook hands with them until their arms ached.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2938,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2939,13
55,Dorothy went to the Witch's cupboard to fill her basket with food for,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2940,13
55,"the journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap.  She tried it on her own",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2941,13
55,head and found that it fitted her exactly.  She did not know anything,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2942,13
55,"about the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2943,13
55,she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2944,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2945,13
55,"Then, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2946,13
55,City; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2947,13
55,carry with them.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2948,13

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2950,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2951,13
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2952,13
55,14.  The Winged Monkeys,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2953,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2954,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2955,14
55,You will remember there was no road--not even a pathway--between the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2956,14
55,castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City.  When the four,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2957,14
55,"travelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2958,14
55,sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her.  It was much harder to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2959,14
55,find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2960,14
55,"daisies than it was being carried.  They knew, of course, they must go",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2961,14
55,"straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2962,14
55,"way.  But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2963,14
55,"which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2964,14
55,"lost in the great fields.  They kept on walking, however, and at night",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2965,14
55,the moon came out and shone brightly.  So they lay down among the sweet,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2966,14
55,smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning--all but the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2967,14
55,Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2968,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2969,14
55,"The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2970,14
55,they were quite sure which way they were going.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2971,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2972,14
55,"""If we walk far enough,"" said Dorothy, ""I am sure we shall sometime",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2973,14
55,"come to some place.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2974,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2975,14
55,"But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2976,14
55,the scarlet fields.  The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2977,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2978,14
55,"""We have surely lost our way,"" he said, ""and unless we find it again in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2979,14
55,"time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2980,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2981,14
55,"""Nor I my heart,"" declared the Tin Woodman.  ""It seems to me I can",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2982,14
55,"scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2983,14
55,"journey.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2984,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2985,14
55,"""You see,"" said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, ""I haven't the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2986,14
55,"courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2987,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2988,14
55,Then Dorothy lost heart.  She sat down on the grass and looked at her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2989,14
55,"companions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2990,14
55,for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2991,14
55,that flew past his head.  So he put out his tongue and panted and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2992,14
55,looked at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2993,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2994,14
55,"""Suppose we call the field mice,"" she suggested.  ""They could probably",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2995,14
55,"tell us the way to the Emerald City.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2996,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2997,14
55,"""To be sure they could,"" cried the Scarecrow.  ""Why didn't we think of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2998,14
55,"that before?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2999,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3000,14
55,Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3001,14
55,since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her.  In a few minutes they,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3002,14
55,"heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3003,14
55,"running up to her.  Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3004,14
55,squeaky little voice:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3005,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3006,14
55,"""What can I do for my friends?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3007,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3008,14
55,"""We have lost our way,"" said Dorothy.  ""Can you tell us where the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3009,14
55,"Emerald City is?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3010,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3011,14
55,"""Certainly,"" answered the Queen; ""but it is a great way off, for you",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3012,14
55,"have had it at your backs all this time.""  Then she noticed Dorothy's",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3013,14
55,"Golden Cap, and said, ""Why don't you use the charm of the Cap, and call",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3014,14
55,the Winged Monkeys to you?  They will carry you to the City of Oz in,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3015,14
55,"less than an hour.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3016,14

55,"""But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3022,14

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3024,14

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3026,14
55,"""Oh, no.  They must obey the wearer of the Cap.  Good-bye!"" And she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3027,14
55,"scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3028,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3029,14

55,"the lining.  These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3031,14
55,directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3032,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3033,14

55,"but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3061,14
55,"quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3062,14
55,woods far below them.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3063,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3064,14

55,"""Once,"" began the leader, ""we were a free people, living happily in the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3077,14
55,"great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3078,14
55,doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master.  Perhaps some,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3079,14
55,"of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3080,14
55,"the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3081,14
55,nuts at the people who walked in the forest.  But we were careless and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3082,14
55,"happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day.  This was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3083,14
55,"many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3084,14
55,land.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3085,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3086,14
55,"""There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3087,14
55,was also a powerful sorceress.  All her magic was used to help the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3088,14
55,"people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good.  Her name",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3089,14
55,"was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3090,14
55,"blocks of ruby.  Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3091,14
55,"she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3092,14
55,"too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise.  At last,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3093,14
55,"however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3094,14
55,years.  Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3095,14
55,"would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3096,14
55,all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3097,14
55,"woman could wish.  When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3098,14
55,"was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3099,14
55,"beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3100,14
55,make everything ready for the wedding.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3101,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3102,14
55,"""My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3103,14
55,"lived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3104,14
55,"joke better than a good dinner.  One day, just before the wedding, my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3105,14
55,grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3106,14
55,beside the river.  He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3107,14
55,"purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3108,14
55,"do.  At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3109,14
55,"their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3110,14
55,dropped him into the water.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3111,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3112,14
55,"""'Swim out, my fine fellow,' cried my grandfather, 'and see if the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3113,14
55,water has spotted your clothes.'  Quelala was much too wise not to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3114,14
55,"swim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune.  He",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3115,14
55,"laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3116,14
55,But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3117,14

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3119,14
55,"""The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it.  She had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3120,14
55,"all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3121,14
55,their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3122,14
55,"treated Quelala, and dropped in the river.  But my grandfather pleaded",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3123,14
55,"hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3124,14
55,"tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3125,14
55,"finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3126,14
55,after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap.  This,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3127,14
55,"Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3128,14
55,have cost the princess half her kingdom.  Of course my grandfather and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3129,14
55,"all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3130,14
55,it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3131,14

55,interested in the story.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3135,14
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3136,14
55,"""Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,"" replied the Monkey,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3137,14
55,"""he was the first to lay his wishes upon us.  As his bride could not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3138,14

55,had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3140,14

55,"the great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before.  Afterward",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3193,15
55,they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City.  When the people,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3194,15
55,heard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3195,15
55,"Witch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3196,15

55,"other travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch;",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3205,15
55,but Oz made no reply.  They thought the Great Wizard would send for,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3206,15
55,"them at once, but he did not.  They had no word from him the next day,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3207,15
55,"nor the next, nor the next.  The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3208,15
55,"at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3209,15
55,after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery.  So the Scarecrow,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3210,15
55,"at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3211,15

55,"had taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3229,15
55,and saw no one at all in the room.  They kept close to the door and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3230,15
55,"closer to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3231,15

55,"was nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3357,15

55,"far that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3391,15
55,"away.  For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3392,15
55,morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3393,15

55,"in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3397,15
55,"thought I was a great Wizard.  Of course I let them think so, because",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3398,15

55,"Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3403,15

55,"""No more than in any other city,"" replied Oz; ""but when you wear green",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3409,15
55,"spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you.  The",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3410,15
55,"Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3411,15
55,"when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now.  But my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3412,15
55,people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3413,15
55,"think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3414,15
55,"place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3415,15
55,"that is needed to make one happy.  I have been good to the people, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3416,15
55,"they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3417,15
55,up and would not see any of them.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3418,15

55,"wonderful things.  There were four of them in this country, and they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3422,15

55,"Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3424,15

55,"terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3426,15
55,"themselves, they would surely have destroyed me.  As it was, I lived in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3427,15
55,deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3428,15

55,"there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3706,17
55,then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3707,17
55,in different shades of the color about them.  It took three days to sew,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3708,17

55,"""The road is straight to the South,"" he answered, ""but it is said to be",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3893,18

55,The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3960,19

55,rested very well indeed.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3994,19

55,In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood.  There,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3996,19
55,"was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3997,19
55,"left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3998,19
55,the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost.  So they,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3999,19

55,"underneath.  So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4004,19
55,"under the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4005,19

55,roughly.  When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4025,19
55,at it so fiercely that he cut it in two.  At once the tree began,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4026,19
55,"shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4027,19
55,safely under it.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4028,19

55,"""Come on!"" he shouted to the others.  ""Be quick!""  They all ran forward",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4030,19
55,"and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4031,19
55,by a small branch and shaken until he howled.  But the Woodman promptly,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4032,19

55,"in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4106,20
55,"pointed caps.  And, strangest of all, these people were all made of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4107,20

55,"picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4146,20

55,moments the entire band stood before her.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4416,22
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4417,22
55,"""What are your commands?"" inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4418,22
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4419,22
55,"""Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,"" answered the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4420,22

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4422,22
55,"""It shall be done,"" said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4423,22
55,caught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4424,22
55,them.  As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4425,22
55,"vexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4426,22
55,"reach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4427,22
55,over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4428,22
55,Quadlings.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4429,22
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4430,22

55,rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4435,22
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4436,22
55,The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy.  There was field,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4437,22
55,"upon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4438,22
55,and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them.  The fences,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4439,22
55,"and houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4440,22
55,been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4441,22
55,"country of the Munchkins.  The Quadlings themselves, who were short and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4442,22
55,"fat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4443,22
55,showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4444,22
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4445,22
55,"The Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4446,22
55,walked up to it and knocked at the door.  It was opened by the farmer's,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4447,22
55,"wife, and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4448,22
55,"all a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4449,22
55,and a bowl of milk for Toto.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4450,22
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4451,22
55,"""How far is it to the Castle of Glinda?"" asked the child.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4452,22
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4453,22
55,"""It is not a great way,"" answered the farmer's wife.  ""Take the road to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4454,22
55,"the South and you will soon reach it.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4455,22
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4456,22
55,"Thanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4457,22
55,and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4458,22
55,"beautiful Castle.  Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4459,22
55,handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4460,22
55,"approached, one of them said to her:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4461,22

55,"me to her?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4466,22

55,"They told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4469,22
55,After a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4470,22
55,were to be admitted at once.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4471,22

55,"Before they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4479,23

55,"Lion shook the dust out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4481,23
55,"into his best shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4482,23
55,joints.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4483,23
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4484,23
55,When they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4485,23
55,into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4486,23
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4487,23
55,She was both beautiful and young to their eyes.  Her hair was a rich,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4488,23
55,red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders.  Her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4489,23

55,upon the little girl.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4491,23

55,"""What can I do for you, my child?"" she asked.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4493,23
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4494,23
55,Dorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4495,23

55,"Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4500,23
55,will make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,4501,23
